# CSK_Template_CameraSetupMerged

CSK Template to show how CSK modules can be merged into one single app and be used/combined to provide basic features for RemoteCamera setup.

## How to Run

The template includes an intuitive GUI to setup a system with multiple cameras.  
The generic UIs of the used CSK modules can also be used for further configurations.  
For further information check out the [documentation](https://raw.githack.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Template_CameraSetupMerged/main/docu/CSK_Template_CameraSetupMerged.html) in the folder "docu".

## Information

Tested on:  
1. SIM1012        - Firmware 2.2.0  
2. SIM2500        - Firmware 1.3.0  
3. SICK AppEngine - Firmware 1.3.2  

**IMPORTANT**
Following CSK modules were merged into this template and should NOT be further developed within this app (see [contribution guideline](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/.github/blob/main/Contribution_Guideline.md) of this GitHub organization):  

  * CSK_1stModule_Logger           (release 4.0.0)
  * CSK_Module_DeviceScanner       (release 2.0.0)
  * CSK_Module_MultiRemoteCamera   (release 5.0.0)
  * CSK_Module_PersistentData      (release 4.0.0)
  * CSK_Module_PowerManager        (release 2.5.0)

This template is part of the SICK AppSpace Coding Starter Kit developing approach.  
It is programmed in an object oriented way. Some of these modules use kind of "classes" in Lua to make it possible to reuse code / classes in other projects.  
In general it is not neccessary to code this way, but the architecture of this app can serve as a sample to be used especially for bigger projects and to make it easier to share code.  
Please check the [documentation](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/.github/blob/main/docu/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit_Documentation.md) of CSK for further information.
